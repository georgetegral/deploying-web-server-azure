## Introduction
For this project, you will write a Packer template and a Terraform template to deploy a customizable, scalable web server in Azure.

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is the management of infrastructure (networks, virtual machines, load balancers, and connection topology) in a descriptive model, using the same versioning as DevOps team uses for source code. Like the principle that the same source code generates the same binary, an IaC model generates the same environment every time it is applied. IaC is a key DevOps practice and is used in conjunction with continuous delivery.

For this project we will use Azure as our cloud provider, in conjunction with Terraform for our IaC needs, and Packer, which will help us with the creation of virtual machine images. 

We will use a Packer template (in JSON format), with a Terraform template to deploy a customizable, scalable web server in Azure.

## Getting Started
In this project we will follow the following steps:
1. Install our dependencies
2. Deploy a policy
3. Create and configure our environment variables
4. Deploy the Packer template
5. Deploy the infrastructure as code with Terraform
